# üîß Troubleshooting Guide
## "Failed to load athletes: Network Error"

This error means the frontend can't connect to the backend server. Follow these steps in order:

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Verify Backend Is Running

**Look at your Backend terminal window.** You should see:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Initializing database...
Database initialized successfully!
```

### If you DON'T see this:
1. Close both terminal windows
2. Run **START_APP.bat** again
3. Wait for both windows to fully load

### If backend window shows errors:
- Check that Python is installed: Open Command Prompt and type `python --version`
- Make sure you ran **SETUP.bat** first
- Try running **SETUP.bat** again

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Test Backend Connection

1. Open a new browser tab
2. Go to: **http://127.0.0.1:8000**
3. You should see JSON like this:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "Sports Medicine - Injury Prevention System API",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "docs": "/docs",
     "status": "running"
   }
   ```

### If you see the JSON:
‚úÖ Backend is working! Continue to Step 3.

### If you see "This site can't be reached":
‚ùå Backend isn't running or is on wrong port.

**Fix:**
1. Close all terminal windows
2. Double-click **STOP_APP.bat**
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Double-click **START_APP.bat** again

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Restart Both Servers

**This fixes 90% of connection issues:**

1. Close both terminal windows (Backend and Frontend)
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Double-click **START_APP.bat**
4. Wait for both windows to open
5. Wait 10 seconds for servers to fully start
6. Refresh your browser (F5)

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Check Windows Firewall

Windows Firewall might be blocking the connection.

1. Press **Windows Key**
2. Type "**Windows Defender Firewall**"
3. Click "**Allow an app through Windows Firewall**"
4. Look for "**Python**" in the list
5. Make sure both **Private** and **Public** checkboxes are checked
6. Click **OK**
7. Restart the application

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Try Different URLs

The frontend might be connecting to the wrong URL.

### Test these URLs in your browser:

1. **http://127.0.0.1:8000** (Should show JSON)
2. **http://localhost:8000** (Should show JSON)
3. **http://127.0.0.1:3000** (Should show the app)
4. **http://localhost:3000** (Should show the app)

### Which one works?
- If **127.0.0.1:8000** works: You're good! ‚úÖ
- If only **localhost:8000** works: Need to reconfigure
- If neither works: Backend isn't running

---

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Clear Browser Cache

Sometimes old data causes issues.

**Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + Delete**
2. Select "**Cached images and files**"
3. Click "**Clear data**"
4. Refresh the page (F5)

**Or use Incognito:**
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + N**
2. Go to **http://127.0.0.1:3000**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 7: Check for Port Conflicts

Another program might be using ports 8000 or 3000.

### Run the troubleshoot script:
1. Double-click **TROUBLESHOOT.bat**
2. It will show which ports are in use

### If ports are blocked:
1. Find and close the program using the port
2. Or restart your computer
3. Run **START_APP.bat** again

---

## ‚úÖ Step 8: Reinstall Dependencies

Dependencies might be corrupted.

1. Close all terminal windows
2. Delete these folders (if they exist):
   - `venv`
   - `frontend\node_modules`
3. Double-click **SETUP.bat**
4. Wait for installation (5-10 minutes)
5. Double-click **START_APP.bat**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 9: Check Python/Node.js Installation

### Check Python:
```cmd
python --version
```
Should show: `Python 3.9.x` or higher

### Check Node.js:
```cmd
node --version
npm --version
```
Should show version numbers

### If not installed:
- **Python**: Download from https://python.org (check "Add to PATH")
- **Node.js**: Download from https://nodejs.org
- Restart computer after installing
- Run **SETUP.bat** again

---

## ‚úÖ Step 10: Manual Start (Advanced)

If launchers don't work, start manually:

### Terminal 1 - Backend:
```cmd
cd C:\path\to\sports_medicine
venv\Scripts\activate
python run_backend.py
```
Wait for: `Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### Terminal 2 - Frontend (new window):
```cmd
cd C:\path\to\sports_medicine\frontend
npm run dev
```
Wait for: `Local: http://localhost:3000`

### Then:
Open browser to **http://127.0.0.1:3000** or **http://localhost:3000**
