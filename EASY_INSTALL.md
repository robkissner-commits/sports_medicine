# üöÄ EASY INSTALL GUIDE - Windows 11

Got the **"No module named 'uvicorn'"** error? Follow these steps:

---

## üìã What You Need First

Before anything else, install these (if not already installed):

### 1. **Python** (Required)
- Go to: **https://python.org/downloads/**
- Download Python 3.9 or newer
- **CRITICAL**: During installation, CHECK the box "Add Python to PATH"
- Click "Install Now"
- Restart your computer after installation

### 2. **Node.js** (Required)
- Go to: **https://nodejs.org/**
- Download the LTS version
- Install with default settings

## ‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP FIX

### Step 1: Verify Python and Node.js

Open **Command Prompt** and type:
```
python --version
```
Should show: `Python 3.x.x`

Then type:
```
node --version
```
Should show: `v18.x.x` or similar

**If either command gives an error:**
- You need to install that software (see above)
- Or Python/Node.js is not in your PATH (reinstall and check "Add to PATH")

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project

Open **Command Prompt** and go to your project folder:
```
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\sports_medicine-main
